# Getting Started
It was made because I want to try Selenium package and lazy to click all links in order to download materials

**Prerequisites**
- C# with Selenium package
- Browser (Firefox, Chrome, IE, ...)
- WebDriver for that browser
- Config browser's profile (Download without asking, Download PDF files, ...)

### Intructions ###
Till now, the program will work like this: (It's quite not smart because I'm a beginner XD)
- Input: A list of links you want to access && A list of keywords
- The program will access to each URL, use keyword to search for the download link and automatically click it
- Voila
